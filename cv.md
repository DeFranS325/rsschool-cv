# ***About me***
Programming is a great workout for the brain. Programming is my job and my hobby. There will always be some idea that it would be interesting to solve on your own, and not install a ready-made program. Programming is magic, you write a "spell" and get the result.

Now I want to gain knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, HTML. There is a desire to get into a team to participate in a project led by an experienced developer to gain new knowledge and experience.

My dream is to participate in game development.
